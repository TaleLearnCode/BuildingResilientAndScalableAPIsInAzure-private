## Short Abstract
Resilient APIs fuel scalable applications. Learn how Azure API Management, Functions, and Azure Container Apps work together to create reliable, high-performing API architectures.

## Abstract
Modern applications demand APIs that can withstand failures and dynamically scale to meet demand. In this session, we’ll explore how Azure API Management, Azure Functions, and Azure Container Apps can help design resilient and scalable APIs that remain operational under pressure.

- High Availability & Disaster Recovery: Architecting APIs to ensure seamless failover and minimal downtime.
- Resilience Strategies: To enhance reliability, implement retry policies, circuit breakers, and throttling.
- Monitoring & Observability: Using Azure Monitor and Application Insights for real-time performance tracking.
- Live Demo & Real-World Scenarios: Watch Azure tools in action as we integrate resilience techniques into a scalable API framework.

Whether you’re a developer, architect, or IT professional, this session provides actionable strategies for future-proofing your APIs and optimizing their reliability in cloud-native environments.
