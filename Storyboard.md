## Opening Hook

**Time:** 3 minutes

- **City Analogy Hook:**
  - NYC: “A city that never sleeps—systems in constant motion.”
  - Berlin: “A city of reinvention—systems adapting through decades.”
- An anecdote or a stat about urban infrastructure resilience.
- Transition: “APIs, like cities, must handle pressure, change, and growth seamlessly.”

### Storyboard

#### Slide 1 – Title & Welcome

**Content:**

- Main title: *“[CITY TITLE]”* (swap per location)
- Subtitle: “Building Resilient and Scalable APIs in Azure”
- Logo/event branding

**Speaker Notes:**

> Welcome everyone. Today, we’re looking at how to design APIs that can handle anything you throw at them — whether that’s a traffic spike, a regional outage, or evolving business demands.
>
> **CITY ANALOGY**:
>
> - NYC – A city that never sleeps - systems in constant motion, always on.
>
> - Berlin – A city of reinvention - systems adapting through decades of change.
>
> - Louisville - A city built on connection - where rivers, rails, and roads converge.
>
> - London - A city of connections - where history and innovation share the same streets.
>
> - Base / No City: In every environment, systems must adapt, scale, and endure.
>
> The techniques we’ll explore are universally applicable, but today we’ll use this city as our metaphorical backdrop.

Include a quick "what's in it for you" statement so the audience knows exactly what they will walk away with.

**Visual Tip:** Hero image of the city skyline, tinted with Azure brand colors.

#### Slide 2 – Agenda

**Content:**

- Intro & Problem Space
- Azure Toolset Overview
- High Availability & DR
- Resilience Strategies
- Monitoring & Observability
- Live Demo
- Blueprint & Wrap-up

**Speaker Notes:**

> We’ll start with the “why,” then work through Azure-based patterns and finish with a live demo. Keep the metaphor in mind — it’ll help link concepts to mental models you already know.

## The API Resilience Problem Space

**Time:** 5 minutes

- Common API failure modes in cloud-native environments:
  - Sudden traffic spikes
  - Upstream dependency failures
  - Latency storms & cascading failures
  - Deployment rollbacks
- Link these to city analogies (rush hour, power grid outage, construction reroutes).
- Why resilience + scalability are non‑negotiable in modern distributed systems.
- Consider a simple visual "API under stress" diagram to reuse later to show how resilience patterns fix each failure mode.

### Storyboard

#### Slide 3 – The Resilience Challenge

**Content:**

- Bullet list: traffic surges, dependency failures, network instability, deployment risk
- Simple diagram showing API under load/failure conditions

**Speaker Notes:**

> APIs are the connective tissue of our applications. If they falter, so does everything else. [CITY ANALOGY: NYC – Rush hour congestion, power grid strain; Berlin – transit strike, sudden influx of visitors during events.]

Include one *short, real incident* (e.g., a major API outage that made headlines) to make the stakes tangible before diving into Azure solutions.

**Visual Tip:** Split-screen with city “stress” image + API stress diagram.

---

## Azure Toolset Overview

**Time:** 5 minutes

**High-level framing, then a deep dive later**

- **Azure API Management (APIM):**
  - Traffic gateway, throttling, caching, policy enforcement.
- **Azure Functions:**
  - Event-driven compute, scale-to-zero, fast horizontal scaling.
- **Azure Container Apps:**
  - Microservice hosting with KEDA-based scale triggers and revisions.
- Tie each to a “city service” analogy.

### Storyboard

#### Slide 4 – Azure’s Resilience & Scale Building Blocks

**Content:**

- Icons & short descriptions for: API Management, Azure Functions, Azure Container Apps
- One sentence per service

**Speaker Notes:**

> Think of these as our “infrastructure departments.” APIM is our gatekeeper and traffic controller. Functions give us elastic, event-driven capacity. Container Apps host and scale microservices intelligently. Together, they create a flexible yet governed API platform.

Add one sentence on *why these three services together* form a cohesive platform - so it's not just a list, but a deliberate combination.

---

## High Availability & Disaster Recovery Design

**Time:** 7 minutes

- **Core Topics:**
  - Multi-region deployments (active-active / active-passive).
  - Traffic manager & front-door routing.
  - Data replication considerations (Cosmos DB, Azure SQL geo-replication).
- **Patterns:** Blue-green & canary deployments.
- **City Layer Example:**
  - NYC: Subway lines with alternate routes.
  - Berlin: S-Bahn/U-Bahn redundancy during disruptions.

### Storyboard

#### Slide 5 – High Availability & Disaster Recovery

**Content:**

- Diagram: active-active multi-region deployment
- HA/DR checklist

**Speaker Notes:**

> HA and DR aren’t optional — they’re foundational. Techniques include multi-region pairing, active-active routing via Azure Front Door, and database geo-replication. [CITY ANALOGY: NYC – multiple subway lines to same destination; Berlin – redundant transit routes and backup systems.]

Explicitly call out *cost vs. resilience trade-offs* - audiences often want to know "how much resilience is enough."

Show a quick "good/better/best" table for deployment patterns.

**Visual Tip:** Azure architecture diagram overlaid with “dual network” or “parallel routes” imagery.

## Resilience Strategies in Practice

**Time:** 8 minutes

- **Retry policies** (exponential backoff, jitter).
- **Circuit breakers** (Polly library example, APIM policies).
- **Throttling and rate limiting** at APIM and app level.
- **Graceful degradation** patterns.
- Map each concept to both a real-world incident and a city analogy.

### Storyboard

#### Slide 6 – Resilience Patterns

**Content:**

- Retry policies (diagram with exponential backoff)
- Circuit breakers (closed/open/half-open states)
- Throttling & rate limiting
- Graceful degradation
- Include a "pattern to pitfall" pairing - e.g., "Retry policies are great, but without jitter they can cause a thundering herd."
- If time allows, show a before/after latency chart to make the benefit visual.

**Speaker Notes:**

> Resilience patterns keep APIs operational under duress. Retry policies mitigate transient failures. Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures. Throttling enforces fairness and stability. [CITY ANALOGY: NYC – rerouting during congestion; Berlin – controlled traffic flow during festivals.]

---

## Monitoring & Observability

**Time:** 5 minutes

- Azure Monitor metrics, alerts.
- Application Insights for distributed tracing.
- Live telemetry dashboards.
- How observability *feeds back* into scaling rules and incident response.
- City analogy:
  - NYC: Real-time MTA dashboards and traffic cams.
  - Berlin: BVG real-time updates & IoT-enabled city projects.
- Tie metrics back to action - e.g., "When this metric cross X, we trigger Y scaling rule."
- Consider a single "observability loop" diagram showing detect → decide → act → learn.

### Storyboard

#### Slide 7 – Monitoring & Observability

**Content:**

- Azure Monitor screenshot
- Application Insights tracing diagram

**Speaker Notes:**

> Observability closes the loop. Azure Monitor captures performance metrics; App Insights traces requests end-to-end. The point is to *see* and *act* before users feel pain. [CITY ANALOGY: NYC – traffic cams & live MTA status; Berlin – IoT sensors and BVG real-time updates.]

---

## Live Demo

**Time:** 8 minutes

- Show Azure APIM + Function + Container App working together:
  1. Baseline API call.
  2. Simulate a sudden traffic spike — trigger auto-scale.
  3. Inject fault — circuit breaker kicks in.
  4. Observe via Azure Monitor / App Insights.
- Keep script identical, but:
  - Change the dataset names, endpoints, or fun touches (e.g., sample payload references “city data”).

### Storyboard

#### Slide 8 – Live Demo

**Content:**

- Step-by-step demo flow (visualized)
- City name in API sample data

**Speaker Notes:**

> We’ll start with a baseline API, then simulate load to trigger scaling. We’ll inject a controlled failure to watch circuit breakers and throttling in action. Finally, we’ll visualize the response in Azure Monitor. Demo data references this city to keep things fun.

- Script in a "what you should be noticing" narration so the audience does not miss key moments
- Have a fallback recording in case of connectivity issues

## Pulling It Together – Design Blueprint

**Time:** 4 minutes

- Reference architecture diagram: how all components integrate.
- Checklist for resilient, scalable API builds in Azure.
- Map to the “city systems” metaphor for location.
- Make the checklist *action-oriented* ("Implement multi-region failover" vs. "Multi-region failover")
- Include a QR code to a resource page (or maybe ensure that is with the event materials and in my standard QR code on the Q&A/Closing slide)

### Storyboard

#### Slide 9 – Blueprint: Putting It All Together

**Content:**

- Reference architecture diagram
- Summary checklist

**Speaker Notes:**

> Here’s your blueprint: architecture, core patterns, and monitoring pipeline. Implementing this ensures your APIs remain reliable, responsive, and auditable — qualities essential in any production environment. [CITY ANALOGY: Reinforce metaphor: “Just as this city’s core services remain online under any circumstance…”]

End with a single, memorable line that ties the city metaphor back to the audience's own systems - something they can quote later.

## Closing & Q&A

**Time:** 5 minutes

- Recap 3 key takeaways:
  1. Architect for failure, not perfection.
  2. Scale with intent — efficiency and cost in mind.
  3. Observe, adapt, improve continuously.
- City-themed motivational closer:
  - NYC: “Just like this city runs 24/7, your APIs can too.”
  - Berlin: “Resilience is reinvention—build APIs that adapt as fast as your needs change.”
- Invite questions.

### Storyboard

#### Slide 10 – Closing & Q&A

**Content:**

- 3 key takeaways:
  1. Architect for failure, not perfection
  2. Scale with intent
  3. Measure everything
- City skyline faded behind text

**Speaker Notes:**

> Whether it’s 3 a.m. in Times Square or a sudden influx in Berlin’s tech district, resilient APIs keep the heartbeat steady. Let’s take questions and talk about your own resilience challenges.
